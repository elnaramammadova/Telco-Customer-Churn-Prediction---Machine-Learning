=========================== HOW TO TEST =====================================
Please run matlab livescript "testing.mlx" to test the final model.
All the necessary data has been loaded. 
The codes were run in university computers without a glitch. 


======================= WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE FOLDER ======================
All the preprocessing, modelling and testing steps are completely reproducible 
and all necessary data is contained in this folder. 

1. "Data_Preperation.ipynp" included:
    - data understanding - visual analysis 
    - outlier removal
    - feature engineering 
            - encoding discrete features 
            - standarization of continious features
    - data splitting - training and testing 
    - SMOTE method on training data 
    
    input: "Telco_customer_churn", "churn.csv"
    output: "churn_postprocess.csv", "train.csv", "train_balanced.csv", "test.csv"
    
    Jupyter Versions: 
    seaborn==0.11.0
    plotly==5.4.0
    pandas==1.1.3
    numpy==1.19.1
    matplotlib==3.3.1
    
    
2. "MLCourseworkFinal_EM.mlx"
    - Single matlab livescript containing training, tuning, testing of all models
    - in order to reproduce add "data" folder to the path
    
    input: "churn_postprocess.csv", "train.csv", "train_balanced.csv", "test.csv"
    output: "MLCourseworkFinal_EM.mat"(not included in the submission due to size),
	    "finalModels.mat" (included in the submission files)

3.  "GridSearch.mlx"
    - Single matlab livescript containing hyperparameter optimization for Random Fores
    - Total of 14 Grid Search results. "GStable14" containes the last and final results.
    
    input: "train.csv", "train_balanced.csv", "test.csv"
    output: "GridSearch.mat"  (not included in the final submission due to size)
    
4. "testing.mlx"
    - the file required for the grader to run. .mat file already loaded. Press RUN to see the results
    
    input: "finalModels.mat"
    output: none
